<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Gargi Tripathi, an enthusiastic Business Administration student at Ahmedabad University. With a strong knack for writing, persuasion, and research, I excel in creating impactful communication. My leadership skills were showcased when I organized a highly successful event for our university’s literary club, which remains one of the highlights of my academic journey.</p>

<p>In addition to my academic pursuits, I have practical experience in copywriting and volunteer work, including co-authoring a published short story and contributing to awareness campaigns at the Shatayu Foundation. These experiences have honed my time management, adaptability, and creative problem-solving abilities.</p>
